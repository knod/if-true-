Plan

RULES:
	Parents:
		An object should only call on its (direct?) children objects' properties
			How about setting tile id or adding tile html to the dom? Tile is
			a child of TileManager, not of GameManager
		An object should only use what is returned to it.
		Keep the container as close to the top as is feasible?
		xqwzts: It's also about limiting how many different classes interface with the same data
	Self:
		Always set 'this' to self. Try not to use a 'this' that can't be
			logically set to self.
		Always change self values at the end of a function
